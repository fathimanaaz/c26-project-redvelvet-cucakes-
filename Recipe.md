1.To make the Redvelvet cupcakes; preheat the oven to 350 degrees and place cupcake papers in a cupcake pan. In a large bowl, sift the dry ingredients (including the sugar) into the bowl of a stand mixer and give it a whisk.

2.In a separate bowl, whisk together the wet ingredients until they are well combined, then add some red food coloring. (The batter may be clumpy but do not worry).

3.Cut the butter into tablespoon sized dollops and add it to the dry ingredients in the stand mixer and beat together. This should get you a sort of crumbly mixture.

4.With your mixer running on low, add the wet ingredients to the dry mixture and mix until everything is incorporated.

5.You may want to add a dash or two more of red food coloring until you reach the desired color.

6.Distribute the batter evenly into the cupcake papers and bake for 15 to 20 minutes or until the cupcakes are golden and springy to the touch.

7.For the cream cheese frosting; start off by sifting the confectioners sugar into a large bowl so there are not any lumps.

8.Cream the room temperature butter in a standing mixer with a paddle attachment on medium speed until it is nice and smooth.

9.Add the cream cheese and beat together until theyâ€™re combined then add the vanilla and salt. Slowly add the sifted confectioners sugar in cups and mix until combined.
